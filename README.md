# turing_machine
The simulator of Turing machine in C++ (in the future - with Qt5 as gui).

It will be new, fresh version of a program made by my lecturer ([screenshot of the window](http://i.imgur.com/qZJU8ZS.png)) with a bunch of new features:

1. ability to use in terminal
2. cross-platform
3. designed module for unit tests of a Control Graph (with assertions)

If you are intrested in - stay tuned!
